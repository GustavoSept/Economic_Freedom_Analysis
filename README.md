# 📁 What's Inside This Repository?
This project is about answering a single (yet quite big and complex) question: how important is Economic Freedom in predicting prosperity?

Along the way, we'll answer other questions, like:
- What's a good proxy for the vague term 'Prosperity'?
- how does each aspect of Economic Freedom correlate with prosperity?
- Does Economic Freedom (or prosperity) increase inequality?
- Is it possible to (partially) explain future growth with current Economic Freedom metrics?

## 🌟 **What's done:**
- Initial Data Acquisition & Cleaning
- Basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time Slider Analysis (to poke at causality explanation)
- Predictive Model (using GradientBoostingRegressor) to project GDP per Capita, given certain features
	- Interactive Plot on Feature Importance
